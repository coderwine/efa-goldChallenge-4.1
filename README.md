You will need to **FORK** this repository (repo) to your own account.  After you have forked it to your account, you will then need to **CLONE** that repo to your computer.  By doing this, you will be able to work through the challenges and push your code back to your own repo.  All instructions are within each file.  Below details the instructions for both challenges.

**4.1 Classes Challenge**

Create a class named Polygon that contains the following information:

    - A constructor method with a parameter to capture information (hint: this should be capturing an array of numbers).
        - assign the parameter to a key using 'this'
    - Has a method named perimeter, that should do the following:
        - return ONLY the parameter, or an empty array from the method
        - call the reduce method on your return value to get a single output value
    

    - Create a new object/instance of the class Polygon that is stored in a variable.
        - The new Polygon should accept an argument that is an array of 4 numbers
    
    - console.log the return value from the newly created Polygon.
